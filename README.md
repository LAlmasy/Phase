# MA1 Project - Convolutional deep neural network for cell segmentation

This project uses a conculutional deep neural networks to segment phase contrast images.

- [mrcnn](./mrcnn): this directory contains the Mask-RCNN implementation of Matterport,
available at: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN,
which is used as a basis for the neural network.

- [phase](./phase): this directory contains the custom configurations of the neural network and the scripts to make predictions
and process the resulting masks.
